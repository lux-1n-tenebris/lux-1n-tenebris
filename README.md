## <p align="center">Greetings to creative people, all over the world! 🌍 🌏 🌎</p>
### <p align="center">I'm a Roku Software Developer - 六 - ろく!</p>
\
Well, how to start?
\
I'm Stefan Radosavljević, and I'm coming from Serbia.
First of all, I'm trying to be a better person, which is mandatory, and then 
to be a better programmer, to write better code, to be more creative and innovative.

### About me: 

I am a father, a husband, and a Roku developer. I also enjoy 3D design, design, games, and photography. When I'm not programming I'm spending my time with my wife and daughter. I like to read books and follow the flow of IT technologies. I miss traveling and getting to know new cultures.


💡 Started as a front-end developer.
\
🎸 I'm trying to learn to play an instrument.

<!-- 📚 I'm currently learning Unity, Blender, and C#. -->
