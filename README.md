### Well, how to start?

I'm Stefan Radosavljević, and I'm coming from Serbia.
As a daily task, I'm trying to improve myself in every aspect, which is a real challenge.

### About me: 

I am a husband, a father, and a Roku Software Developer. I also enjoy 3D design, games, and photography. When I'm not programming, I'm spending my time with my wife and daughter. I like to read books and follow the flow of IT technologies. I miss traveling and getting to know new cultures.
